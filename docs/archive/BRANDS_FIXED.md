# ✅ Brand Images Fixed!

## **Problem Solved**
The brand images were in the wrong location (`media/brands/`) instead of Next.js's public folder (`public/media/brands/`).

## **What Was Done**
✅ Copied all 12 brand images to `public/media/brands/`
✅ Images now accessible at: `/media/brands/brand1.png` etc.

## **Refresh Your Browser**
The dev server is already running. Simply:
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000**
2. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Scroll down to the "Brand Partners" section

## **Brand Images Now Available**
- brand1.png through brand12.png
- 12 brand logos total
- Displayed in a responsive grid on homepage

**Status:** ✅ Fixed - Brands should now load on homepage!
